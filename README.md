### Development status: It works. Lazy bums can install this extension from [the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kobgjacjhaakkgpakjkocgoemmcgcjkj?hl=en&gl=US).

Have you ever had a shortage of open browser tabs? Well you're in luck, because this Chrome extension will make sure you have *plenty* of open tabs. Just select some stuff on a page, right-click, and choose "Open all links in selection." Kaboom! Every link in your selection will open in a new tab!

This extension is best combined with TV Tropes.
