# Linksplosion

##Development status: Not even working. Don't waste your time downloading this.

Have you ever had a shortage of open browser tabs? Well you're in luck, because this Chrome extension will make sure you have *plenty* of open tabs. Just select some stuff on a page and click the icon. Every link in your selection will open in a new tab!

This extension is best combined with TV Tropes.
